General Introduction of USDEX

Your files will pass through the USDE-x network, becoming digitally signed across any additional blockchains of your choosing.
With USDE-x, your encrypted transactions result in files being verified and stored forever across multiple blockchain ledgers;
adding an uncompromising level of security by allowing other blockchains to store the hash while simultaneously making man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult than ever before.
This heightened sense of security will allow us to further polarize USDE-x from the rest of the emerging altcoin market,
proving the original spirit of USDE is still with us moving forward after the coinswap. Our mission is to expand on our moral philosophy of a one unified digital world currency. 
Our team is working on bridging the gaps between altcoin blockchains in the same way USDE-x transactions unite markets across borders. USDE-x plans on ever increasing our investment potential, 
allowing our clients to mine and stake for a broad range of associated alt coins from within our own robust pool,
increasing the potential workload for our clients, ensuring a future in mining for our community, and exponentially increase value with every new associate blockchain we add while moving forward.

USDEX uses a special algorithm called the POW/POS to secure the USDEX network. The moment you acquire USDEX it becomes an interest bearing asset with 120% return per year through PoS minting. All you have to do to earn with this method is to hold coins in your USDEX-QT wallet. In addition to PoS minting, USDEX coin can be mined with CPU/GPU and does not need an ASIC miner like Bitcoin does.
